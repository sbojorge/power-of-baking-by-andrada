            <p>Baking is my story of love and sharing. It started in my childhood and has been growing in my heart since
                then.<br>
                I learned at my grandma's kitchen in Romania where she taught me and where we spent time together baking
                for our family during Christmas holidays.<br>
                Pies were my very first creations. It filled my heart seeing my family enjoying them.<br>
                As I grew up my interest and curiosity in baking kept going. Creativity came out. I got the taste of
                trying new flavours and following my own recipes.<br>
                I baked my first cake for my best friend's birthday while we were in college. "I've never eaten a cake
                like this" she said. We had some much fun that day!<br>
                Baking has become my playground, my escape room. It's my special treat to others.<br>
