            <p>Baking is my story of love and sharing. It started in my childhood and has been growing in my heart since
                then.<br>
                I learned at my grandma's kitchen in Romania where she taught me and where we spent time together baking
                for our family during Christmas holidays.<br>
                Pies were my very first creations. It filled my heart seeing my family enjoying them.<br>
                As I grew up my interest and curiosity in baking kept going. Creativity came out. I got the taste of
                trying new flavours and following my own recipes.<br>
                I baked my first cake for my best friend's birthday while we were in college. "I've never eaten a cake
                like this" she said. We had some much fun that day!<br>
                Baking has become my playground, my escape room. It's my special treat to others.<br>

        <p>During these last few years Andrada made my birthday cakes and they are the best I've ever had.
            Andrada has a real gift for baking. One can really tell that she's passionate with what she does.</p>
        <p>Andrada made two amazing and delicious birthday cakes for my son.
            She paid attention to every little detail and surprised us with a perfect decoration that we all loved.
            We also had 3 different kind of yummy cupcakes, they were just perfect for an afternoon with 10 kids!
            I'd definitely order again, every cake is unique and full of her natural talent and kindness.</p>
        <p>Andrada makes the best lemon pie EVER!!!</p>
        <p>Fresh cakes baked with love and passion. The incredible taste and smooth texture made us order again and
            again. We have enjoyed her cakes at every occasion.</p>
