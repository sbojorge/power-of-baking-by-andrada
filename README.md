The shop will be updated with new products under availability.

* **Contact me**: Users that will be interested in ordering a cake can contact Andrada using the form available on this page.

* **Thank you**: Currently the contact form is missing the required code for sending the information to a server. A "Thank you" page is loaded instead right after the user submits the form.

* **Restrictive blanks in the contact form**: The form can be improved by restricting the email and phone number blanks to only accept the right information i.e only numbers for a phone number and a "username@domain" for the email address.
