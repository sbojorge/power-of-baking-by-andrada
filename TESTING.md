# Testing

All links were tasted manually and they work:

* Internal links
* Navigation bar links
* Back to top link

The links for going from another page to the internal links on the Home page work as well.

Social media links work and open on a new tab.

On the footer, the email link opens the user's email editor to send an email to powerofbakingbyandrada@gmail.com

The thank you page is loaded after submitting the form which confirms that the form works correctly.
